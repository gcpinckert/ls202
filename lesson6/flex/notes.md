# Flex Project

What do we need to do to get from what we have to the completed product?

- We want the heading to stretch to fill the space
- We need to convert the nav bar to a set of horizontal links
- Each link should take up equal space within the nav bar
- We want to set up the article and two asides in a 3 column layout, with the article in the middle and an aside on either side of it. These should be vertically alligned, with the article taking up 50% of available space and each aside given 25% of available space.
- The image should be a part of the 2 column footer, aligned to the left
- Footer text should be right aligned horizontally, but vertically centered
