# Grid Project

- Create a heading that spans the entire width of available space
- Convert the nav bar to horizontal
- Article 1 and Asides 1 and 2 should be in a three column layout, where the article is in the middle and takes up 50% of the available space and each aside is on either side and takes up 25% of available space
- Article 2 and Aside 3 should be in a two column layout, where the article takes up 75% of the available space and the aside takes up 25% of the available space
- The footer should also have this format, with the image taking up 25% of the available space and the copyright taking up the 75%.

potential structure:

```
header header header header
nav    nav    nav    nav
aside1 art.1  art.1  aside2
aside3 art.2  art.2  art.2
foot   foot   foot   foot

---

nav is a grid within a grid:
a1 a2 a3 a4 a5

foot is a grid within a grid:
img cpy cpy cpy
```
